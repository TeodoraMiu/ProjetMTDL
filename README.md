An Android app I worked on during the MTDL subject in third year.

The project is an Android application that facilitates the process of donating blood. 
- Potential donors can make appointments at hospitals to donate blood, after completing a form that ensures that they are elligible for donating.
- Hospitals can post announcements based on their needs (blood type, amount of blood, urgency).

It was a fun little project that taught me the basics of building an Android application.
